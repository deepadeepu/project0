Created 3 pages. 
1.index.html
2.gallery.html
3.contact.html

For index page I have created a style.css file which was included in every other html page.

footer is same in every html page.

In Index page I have created header with shadow effects and side bar menu and in the body images change every 3secs.
for changing images I used java script code which is included in index page.

In gallery page I have used Grid style and added images downloaded from internet.

In the contact us page I have used SCSS style coding. In this page I have added color change for screen change.

I have  changed code for screen changes and it is mobile responsive.
